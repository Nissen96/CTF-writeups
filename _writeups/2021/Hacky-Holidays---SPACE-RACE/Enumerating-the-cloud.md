    The spaceship that you will use in SPACE RACE is almost ready. One of the last steps is to verify that all of the systems are operational. Unfortunately, the AI controlling the system information decided to take a personal time off for a few days, leaving you without an easy access to the spaceship systems. This is not a problem because, as the cyber security specialist in the ship, you know the spaceship cloud infrastructure like the back of your hand.
