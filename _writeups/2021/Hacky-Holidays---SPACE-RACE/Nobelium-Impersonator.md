    The spacestation's second in command had their machines compromised. During a forensic investigation we found a suspicious PDF. Our initial analysis indicates that someone is trying to leverage some TTPs from a known threat actor. But what did they do? Looks like they grabbed some existing code from GitHubâ€¦

    ### Command [150 points]
    Can you find out the full command that is executed?
