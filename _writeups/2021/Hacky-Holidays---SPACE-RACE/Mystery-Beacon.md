    We've found this piece of hardware next to a rocket. Time to investigate!

    ### LED [75 points]
    The left LED is blinking, I think it might be telling us something?

    ### Sound [75 points]
    Hm? What's that noise?

    ### Analyze [75 points]
    It seems a component was destroyed while handling the board. If only there was a way to see what it was for...

    Hint: It seems not only the board was messed up, but the flag as well.

    ### Combination [75 points]
    It seems like all three signals were playing at the same time. Maybe whoever made this is trying to tell us something...
