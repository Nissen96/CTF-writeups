    You arrived at the launch platform of SPACE RACE. Teams around you are preparing for the event the best they can by gathering their crew and designing their flag.

    At the outset of the camp you notice the Hacky Holidays admin base, you decide to stake-out and see what's happening. After a while you notice that people are only allowed to access the admin base when they show the Hacky Holidays admin flag below.

    ### Identify yourself [50 points]
    Open the flag designer and see if you can hack your way into the admin base.
