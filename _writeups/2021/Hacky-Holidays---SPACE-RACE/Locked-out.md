    After a relaxing space walk, you realize that you have been locked out of your spaceship by the spaceship's AI. Thankfully, you remember that you prepared for this eventuality by storing access keys in an external storage.

    ### Obtaining external access keys [25 points]
    Open the [external storage](https://external-spaceship-storage-b38e8c6.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/) and see if there is something useful in there.

    ### Checking your internal storage [25 points]
    You have managed to get keys. See if you can get inside and check the internal spaceship storage.
